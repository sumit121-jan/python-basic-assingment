        "1. How it works\n",
        "   The interpreter reads the source code, breaks it down into tokens, and checks the syntax. If the code is syntactically correct, the interpreter generates bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code. The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) then executes the bytecode to perform the specified operations and generate the output.\n",

        "   A compiler also translates high-level code into machine code, but before execution. An interpreter translates the code into instructions that the computer can understand, executing them line by line."
